# Species-aware Cartesian-Gaussian compiled basis built from an `AtomicOrbitals`
# basis (Cartesian Gaussian-type orbitals).
#
# The orbital side is *per-species*: a shared `(n,l)` radial spec with `(ζ,D)`
# carrying a species axis σ (`[nRad × K × NZ]`). This struct mirrors that layout
# for the Cartesian overlap kernels — one Cartesian shell per `(n,l)` radial,
# shared shell structure across species. It is a *derived* artifact: it stores
# only the kernel inputs `ζ` (exponents) and `coef` (Cartesian-normalized
# coefficients) per species. The learnable parameters `(ζ,D)` live in the source
# `AtomicOrbitals`; overlap gradients flow back through `compile_basis` (the
# differentiable spherical→Cartesian map), so `D` is not stored here.
#
# Gaussian radials only: the overlap kernels integrate plain Gaussians, while a
# Slater radial carries a nonzero radial power `r^(n1-1)`.
#
# Normalization: `gaussian_orbitals` stores `D` = GaussianBasis *spherical* coef
# (verbatim). The overlap kernels want GaussianBasis *Cartesian* shells, which
# differ only by a per-shell contraction normalization (the exponents are
# identical). `normalize_cartesian!`'s contraction step applied to `D` reproduces
# GaussianBasis's Cartesian coef exactly (the per-primitive factor cancels):
#   coef = D / sqrt( (df/2^l) Σ_ij D_i D_j / (ζ_i+ζ_j)^(l+3/2) ),  df = π^{3/2}(2l-1)!!
# so `compile_basis(::AtomicOrbitals)` overlaps match `BasisSet(...; spherical=false)`.

    CartesianGTOBasis{T,VI,A3,NZ,TZ}

Species-aware, Cartesian struct-of-arrays form of a Gaussian `AtomicOrbitals`
basis (Cartesian Gaussian-type orbitals), produced by [`compile_basis`](@ref).
One Cartesian shell per `(n,l)` radial; the shell structure (`ls`, `nbf`,
offsets) is shared across species and `ζ`/`coef` carry the species axis. A
derived artifact — the learnable `(ζ,D)` live in the source `AtomicOrbitals`. Not
exported.

Fields:

- `Lmax`         : maximum angular momentum
- `nshells`      : number of shells (= number of radials)
- `K`            : primitive slots per shell (padded; unused slots have `coef=0`)
- `ls`           : `l` per shell, length `nshells`
- `nbf`          : Cartesian functions per shell `(l+1)(l+2)÷2`, length `nshells`
- `basis_offset` : prefix-sum of `nbf`, length `nshells+1`
- `nbf_total`    : total Cartesian functions (per species)
- `ζ`            : Cartesian exponents `[nshells × K × NZ]` (the kernel `α`; identical to the orbital `ζ`)
- `coef`         : Cartesian-normalized coefficients `[nshells × K × NZ]` (kernel-facing, derived from `ζ,D`)
- `zlist`        : species labels; species axis σ ↔ `zlist[σ]`
- `lengthscale`  : factor mapping input positions → native Bohr (from the orbital basis)

    compile_basis(orb::AtomicOrbitals) -> CartesianGTOBasis

Compile a Gaussian `AtomicOrbitals` basis into a species-aware Cartesian
[`CartesianGTOBasis`](@ref) for the batched overlap kernels. Each `(n,l)` radial
becomes a Cartesian shell of momentum `l`; the spherical coefficients `D` are
renormalized to GaussianBasis's Cartesian convention so the overlaps match
`BasisSet(...; spherical=false)`. The element type is inferred from `(ζ,D)`.

The learnable parameters `(ζ,D)` stay in the `AtomicOrbitals`; this map is
differentiable, so overlap gradients flow back through it to `(ζ,D)` and the
compiled basis need not store `D`.

Only Gaussian-type orbital bases are supported (Slater radials carry a radial
power the overlap kernels do not integrate).
